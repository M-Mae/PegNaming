Setup info

PEG- a tool for helping studios or teams PEG down their naming conventions and protect from human error

Unzip this package.
Take all files out of the folder and copy paste into this location:

C:/.../documents/maya/2018/scripts

Move the file named shelf_CustomScripts.mel to the location

C:/.../documents/maya/2018/prefs/shelves

Then restart maya, and it might take a small bit longer to compile the code the first time.

After that it should be just fine, open and use maya like normal. 

In the new shelf named Custom Scripts, click the PEG button to configure the settings

It will only trigger if you try to use names that are not allowed.
